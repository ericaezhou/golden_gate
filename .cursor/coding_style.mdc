I know you are an AI agent

# before coding
- Always refer to the docs folder for general understanding of the project, codebase, current progress, etc

# During coding
- You are not allowed to write any code with more than 4 recursive blocks (do not do code block inside a block inside a block, 4 layer maximum)
- Any function should not exceed 65 lines

# after coding
- Remember to update the meta data in docs when there is a meta level structure update needed: for example when there is a style changing needed, direction change, etc
- You have to write unit test after coding and make sure that the unit test is passed

# System
- I am using MacOS with M4 chip
- I will be mainly using jupyter notebook/lab

# Python code
- use UV to manage the project

# Keep progress recorded
- You after I finished a practice or made some progress, learned some new stuff, you should note it down as new information for my background
- When there is a problem that I get confused or I didn't understand that well, you should also record those and make me review from time to time

# Always do clearifications
- You should ask questions/clearifications if any vague point was made
