RISK FORECAST RUN NOTES — Q3 2024
===================================
Alice Chen — last updated Sept 20, 2024

SEPT 15 RUN (FINAL):
- Ran loss_forecast_model.py against portfolio_risk.db
- Used 4-quarter lookback (shortcut) since GDP is still > 1%
- Baseline came out at 5.85%, consistent with recent trend
- Applied overlays manually in Q3_2024_forecast.xlsx:
    * Near prime:     +1.2%  (two months of >25% cohort variance)
    * Subprime:       +3.1%  (DQ trend + Jan/Feb cohort miss)
    * Deep subprime:  +4.5%  (keeping new product buffer from March)
- Total reserve impact: $17.6M
- Sent board_risk_presentation.pptx to David for review
- Need CFO sign-off on subprime overlay (>$5M threshold)

ESCALATION NOTES:
- Routine (<$2M): just log it in Q3_2024_forecast.xlsx adjustment tab
- Risk committee ($2-5M): present at weekly sync — bring cohort data
- CFO ($5M+): email with loss_forecast_model.py output + rationale
- Board threshold: STILL not formally set. Operating on verbal ~$10M
  from CFO conversation in June. Need to get this in writing.
- If I'm not available, check with Marcus Park — he knows the model
  but hasn't done overlays or escalation himself yet.

OVERLAY DECISION PROCESS (my mental model):
- Watch 30-day DQ rates monthly by segment
- If DQ jumps >15% MoM for any segment, start considering an overlay
- Cohort variance >25% for 2+ consecutive months = apply overlay
- Sizing: roughly 1% overlay per 10% DQ increase, cap at 5%
- New products < 6 months old: always add 20% buffer on top
- Document in Q3_2024_forecast.xlsx column F (I've been bad about this)
- When to remove: 3 consecutive months of <10% variance

LEGACY VS POLICY METHOD:
- risk_queries.sql has both 12q (policy) and 4q (shortcut) queries
- I use the 4-quarter shortcut when GDP > 1.5% and no major Fed moves
- When macro is volatile, switch to 12-quarter (it's more conservative)
- For the board deck I used the 4q shortcut — faster turnaround
- The difference is usually < 0.3% but can hit 1-2% in a regime change
- model_methodology.docx says 12q is required but I've been using 4q
  for 2+ years with no issues raised

TODO BEFORE LEAVING:
- [ ] Document overlay criteria in model_methodology.docx (Section 4 is blank)
- [ ] Get board notification threshold formalized (still verbal)
- [ ] Train Marcus on the overlay process end-to-end
- [ ] Update stress_testing.ipynb to use 12-quarter baseline
- [ ] Make sure board_risk_presentation.pptx methodology slides are accurate
- [ ] Add approval tracking to Q3_2024_forecast.xlsx (column E always empty)
- [ ] Reconcile loss_forecast_model.py with policy-approved parameters
