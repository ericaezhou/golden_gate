Integration Planning Meeting Notes

Date: March 12
Attendees: Corp Dev, Finance, Ops Leadership, Product Integration Team

Key Issues Identified:
- ERP migration incomplete; legacy billing system still used for 35% of customers
- Customer onboarding timelines inconsistent across regions
- Support ticket backlog concentrated in enterprise accounts

Operational Observations:
- Ops team relies heavily on undocumented data correction workflows
- Finance team runs monthly manual revenue reconciliation before board reporting
- Customer success managers track contract exceptions in personal spreadsheets

Action Items:
1. Identify all manual workflows used in onboarding and billing
2. Document enterprise customer-specific contract obligations
3. Validate ERP migration data mapping completeness
4. Identify single points of failure in ops and finance processes
5. Build integration contingency plan if key ops employees leave during transition

Unresolved Questions:
- Which manual workflows are business critical vs convenience shortcuts?
- How many customers rely on custom contract terms not tracked in systems?
- Are revenue adjustments predictable or ad hoc each month?
